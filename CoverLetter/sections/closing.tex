%Achieving ambitious marketing goals is always a top priority, and I am always looking out for the best interests of the company. I enjoy delivering marketing presentations to potential clients and focusing on the strengths of an organization. My marketing skills at River Tech enabled the company to experience new levels of success and a 45\% increase in customer engagement. I am never satisfied with the status quo, and I believe that a company should continually look for ways to improve and reach new clients through innovative campaigns.

After a few years of contributing in that role I was promoted to another role in the same team focusing on our tools architecture and processes.
In this role I work to define best practices for the team and manage the deployment processes for the team.
For this domain, deployments have the added problem of the destination often times is a \textit{closed area} program, on an air-gaped network. To achieve this the we created automated infrastructure that sets up our architecture for the admins of any program.
This role gave me experience in defining coding practices, infrastructure as code tools, CI/CD tools, all while continuing to learn and sharpen my coding skills.
